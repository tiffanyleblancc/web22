        <h2>Cleaning Up Your Digital Footprint</h2>
        <p>Growing up we've all heard the phrase, "Everything you put on the internet is permanent." A digital footprint is your online identity. Knowlege is power, and most people would be stunned to see what strangers can find out about you. Especailly with some social media platforms becoming more "casual", users feel more comfortable posting and commenting wildly innapropriate things. Your digital footprint builds an online reputation, and it's important to be aware of it because anything posted online is permanent.</p>
        <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
        <p>Fast fashion has an impact on the environment through carbon emissions. The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global CO2 emissions each year. The fashion trend cycle has seemed to only increase due to the pandemic, thus making the mass production of clothes move quickly from design to retail stores to meet these trends. They quickly go to landfill because the trend cycle was short lived and it's on the the next and the cycle repeats.</p>
        <h2>Cajun Culture</h2>
        <p>Cajun Culture is one of the most unique cultures and ethnic groups in the United States, but not many people know what it is. Acadians were originally peasants in the West Central part of France that were recruited to go to Canada. After
 90 years of residing there, the British forced out the Acadians out by boat, and eventually arrived in South Louisiana where they became known as Cajuns.
